# Hash-Based Steganography

![Hash-Based Steganography](https://example.com/hash_steganography.png)

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a hash-based steganography technique, which involves hiding data within the hashes of other data. Hash-based steganography is a method of concealing information within hash values generated from original content.

## Features

- Encode secret messages into the hash values of data
- Decode hidden messages from hash values
- Support for various hash algorithms
- Simple and intuitive API for integration into applications
- Minimal distortion of original data

## Usage

To encode a message into the hash value of data:

```python
from hash_steganography import HashSteganography

message = "This is a secret message"
data = "Original data to be encoded"
encoded_data = HashSteganography.encode(data, message)
print("Encoded data:", encoded_data)
```

To decode a message from the hash value of data:

```python
from hash_steganography import HashSteganography

encoded_data = "Encoded data with hidden message"
decoded_message = HashSteganography.decode(encoded_data)
print("Decoded message:", decoded_message)
```

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```
pip install hash-steganography
```

## Examples

Check out the [examples](./examples) directory for usage examples and sample code snippets.
